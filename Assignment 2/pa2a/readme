Assignment 2: Game

For the update method, I created a new board, which keeps track of every (i,j)th tile's neighbors.

I then compare the (i,j)th tiles of the update board with the old board, and adjust the values of the old board accordingly.

Big O:

Running time: O(n), for n tiles

Space Complexity: O(2n) = O(n)
